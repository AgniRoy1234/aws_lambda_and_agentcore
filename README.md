## AWS Agents – Repository Overview

### `lambda_agent_final_code`

This repository contains the code for a Lambda-oriented agent server that exposes LLM-powered capabilities behind an AWS-friendly interface. It focuses on handling incoming requests, invoking language models and tools, and returning structured responses suitable for use in serverless or containerized deployments.

### `multiagent_final_codes`

This repository implements multi-agent and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. It coordinates multiple specialized agents, manages retrieval from backing stores (such as vector databases or OpenSearch), and composes their outputs into a unified response for complex tasks.

### `lambda_indexing_function_code`

This repository hosts the Lambda-based indexing or ingestion function that prepares data for RAG-style retrieval. It is responsible for processing raw documents, generating embeddings, and writing them into the configured search or vector index so they can be queried efficiently by the agent systems.
